Hey there! I'm Eric - welcome to my github home!

I'm a long-time musician who has always had an interest in dabbling in computer programming.

At an early age I was programming BASIC on my family's TI-99-4A in our basement.  After that I used DOS on an IBM machine, before purchasing my first true Windows PC in the late 90's.

Because I had primarly focused on music during my teens and 20's(school, and later touring), my interest in programming had waned a bit while pursuing a musical career. I briefly and unsuccessfully dabbled in Python around the early 2k's. 

Prior to the 2020 covid pandemic I was averaging about 16 gigs per month and everything was running along fairly smoothly.  Once the shutdown happened, that scene went away for about a year and a half.

Which left me plenty of time to seize the opportunity to finally learn programming.  At the advice of a close friend and the interwebs in general, I dove into and was quickly endeared to HTML, CSS & JS.  Then, once I felt like I had a fairly decent grasp on those languages, I challenged myself with React.

Now I enjoy developing websites using a stack of Gatsbyjs and strapi CMS deployed to render.com.  I feel like front-end development is my jam (I *really* like CSS ðŸ¤£, thank you Kevin Powell ðŸ™ƒ) but I could definitely see getting into full-stack or back-end coding if the opportunity presented itself.

Currrently (2022) I play music mostly on the weekends (I'm primarily a drummer, and freelance with several area bands) up and down the west coast of Florida, and I also teach lessons on Tuesday evenings.  I also enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife, maintaining our amazing home, and messing with the three prettiest kitties ðŸ˜» in the universe!
